# NOTICE
This is going to be my last project for a while, as I am moving onto bigger things that will take longer (RCPing is an example). I will still post here on github, Just not as often as most would like. But I still have some good news, Soon I will be getting an ABN (Australian Buisness Number) so this can be an actual company. and I will also make a website depending if my HP T620 thin client wants an OS
